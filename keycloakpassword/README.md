Keycloak Password Auth
======================

Allows for password-based authentication against a Keycloak backend. (Should in
theory work with any OpenID Connect provider with "direct grant" enabled, but
it's only been tested against Keycloak.)

Setting up Keycloak for use with this addon is detailed [in this RedHat
blog entry](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/01/29/api-login-and-jwt-token-generation-using-keycloak#set_up_a_client).
