To let the connector work properly you should define an application name in `config/pumpio.config.php`:

	return [
		'pumpio' => [
			'application_name' => '',
			// Displays forwarded posts like "wall-to-wall" posts.
			'wall-to-wall_share' => false,
			// Given in minutes
			'poll_interval' => 5,
		],
	];

This name appears at pump.io and is important for not mirroring back posts that came from Friendica.
