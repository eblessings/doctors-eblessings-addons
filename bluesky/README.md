Bluesky Addon
==============

This addon supports posting to and receiving posts from Bluesky.

No setup is needed for the admins to make it work for their users.

Bluesky itself is under development as well. It is planned to make it decentral.
The addon is prepared to support different servers. But it isn't enabled yet.
