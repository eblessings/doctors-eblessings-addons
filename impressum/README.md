About
-----
This addon adds an Impressum (contact) block to the /friendica page with informations about the page operator/owner and how to contact you in case of any questions.

In the notes and postal fields you can use bbcode tags for formatting, like in normal friendica postings..

Configuration
-------------
Simply fill in the fields in the impressium settings page in the addons area of your admin panel. For email adresses the "@" symbol will be obfuscated in the source of the page to make in harder for harvesting tools.

Manual Configuration
--------------------
If you for any reason you prefer to use a configuration file instead, you can set the following variables in the `config/impressum.config.php` file

	return [
		'impressum' => [
			'owner' => '',           // This is the Name of the Operator
			'ownerprofile' => '',    // This is an optional Friendica account where the above owner name will link to
			'email' => '',           // A contact email address (optional)
									 // Will be displayed slightly obfuscated as name(at)example(dot)com
			'postal' => '',          // Should contain a postal address where you can be reached at (optional)
			'notes' => '',           // Additional informations that should be displayed in the Impressum block
			'footer_text' => '',     // Text that will be displayed at the bottom of the pages.
		],
	];
